				<p>Soul of Cinder is an amalgamation of previous Lords of Cinder such as Lord Gwyn and the Chosen Undead (assuming he survives and manages to link the flame in his world), and every other character who has ever linked the First Flame. This is confirmed by his Japanese name, Incarnation of Kings (王たちの化身, lit. Outachi no Keshin), as well as the description from the Soul of the Lords. As such, he wields the combined abilities, weapons, and magic of his components, giving him tremendous power.</p>

				<p>"Since Lord Gwyn, the first Lord of Cinder, many exalted lords have linked the First Flame, and it is their very souls that have manifested themselves as defender of the flame." - Soul of the Lords.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
